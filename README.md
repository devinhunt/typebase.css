# typebase.css
## A starting point for good typography on the web

**typebase.css** aims to provide a minimal CSS typography boiler plate. Most css frameworks fail web typography in one of a few ways:

1. They contain built-in aesthetics
2. Inconsistent vertical rhythm across major elements
3. Hard to decouple from the rest of the framework

Both force designers & developers to do extra work to realize their design. Let typebase.css handle the vertical rhythm and spacing, you handle the typefaces and design.

## Goals for typebase.css
### Enforced vertical rhythm
The most important thing that typebase.css gives you is an enforced vertical rythm across ~~all~~ most screens (working on mobile). This insures that text across columns and long copy doesn't become uneven.

### Built to be edited
Like [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) typebase.css is built to be edited. You'll find comments throughout the source marking points left for intentional editing. You should substitute your own typefaces in. Don't like how the headings scale? Change it!

## Contributing to typebase.css
This project is meant to be a conversation about good typography. I learn design from other designers. Gimme yo' pull requests.
